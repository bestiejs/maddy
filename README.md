Maddy
=====

**Maddy** is a functional programming micro-library inspired by [Underscore](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/) and [FuseJS](http://www.fusejs.com/). It provides numerous iteration functions for arrays and objects, as well as additional utility methods for type checking and deep equality testing.

Maddy is environment and framework-agnostic, and is compatible with web browsers, [CommonJS](http://www.commonjs.org/) implementations, and JavaScript engines. It also provides consistent support for older, buggy environments, such as Internet Explorer 5.5 and Safari 2.

The [annotated source code](http://kitgoncharov.github.com/maddy/docs/maddy.html) is available. Full documentation and unit tests are coming soon...
